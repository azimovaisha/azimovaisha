- 👋 Hello there, name's Aisha
- 👀 I’m interested in all things OOP and WebDev
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a personal landing page and a music recommendation bot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Java desktop application projects! Not yet ready for Android stuff, I'd say.
- 📫 I like playing online games such as League of Legends and Overwatch.
  I cannot function properly without music! I listen to all kinds of genres, but I prefer classical music while coding.
